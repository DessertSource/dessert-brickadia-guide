## Preface

!!! warning
    **This is nowhere near completion yet! I'm pushing this as a test.**

This guide is my personal take on an all-purpose guide
that's geared towards making newcomers understand the
mechanics of Brickadia in a more simplified manner.

To get a general idea of the features in Brickadia,
I have curated certain pages for first-time viewers.
These pages are meant to provide you with the basics
of the game's mechanics. More advanced features can
be found in other tabs/pages.

This guide does not cover the technical aspects of
the game, like setting up a server or installing the game.
Please refer to other communities for technical advice.

This is a part-time project I'm investing in. I am not obligated
to instantly update the guide after seconds of new updates coming out.
Be mindful of your requests.

Feedback can be given on the Github repository.
