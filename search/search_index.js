Modern systems will support and take advantage of DirectX 12 with no issue. For older systems, I recommend DirectX 11 for better performance on those systems. For systems with inadequate CPU or GPU, the Simple Graphics option serves as a fallback option in case of catastrophic performance. You wouldn't explode a potato.</p> <p>An aspect ratio of 16:9 is ideal as the UI is built for wide-screen and will down-size if you choose something like 4:3. Brickadia also supports capping at framerates higher than 60 for those with displays of higher refresh rate. It also has an unfocused framerate cap, which will help save on GPU resources if you are working on something else while Brickadia is open in the background.</p> <p>You can expect varying levels of performance due to the natural variance of servers and worlds, meaning there is no central benchmark. Some worlds or servers will be heavy on performance, and some may be light enough to be able to run on integrated graphics without going under tolerable framerates.</p>"},{"location":"FAQ/general.html#communication-channels","title":"Communication Channels","text":"<p>You can follow or interact the official Brickadia social media accounts here:</p> <ul> <li>TikTok</li> <li>Youtube</li> <li>Twitter ...or X but I will give you a side eye</li> <li>Instagram</li> <li>Bluesky</li> <li>Reddit</li> </ul>"},{"location":"FAQ/general.html#forums","title":"Forums","text":"<p>We have a Discord, but no forum yet.
