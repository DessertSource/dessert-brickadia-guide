I'm pushing this as a test.</p> <p>This guide is my personal take on an all-purpose guide that's geared towards making newcomers understand the mechanics of Brickadia in a more simplified manner.</p> <p>To get a general idea of the features in Brickadia, I have curated certain pages for first-time viewers. These pages are meant to provide you with the basics of the game's mechanics. More advanced features can be found in other tabs/pages.</p> <p>This guide does not cover the technical aspects of the game, like setting up a server or installing the game. Please refer to other communities for technical advice.</p> <p>This is a part-time project I'm investing in. I am not obligated to instantly update the guide after seconds of new updates coming out.
