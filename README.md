# dessert-brickadia-guide

A Brickadia guide I am in charge of.

> [!WARNING]
> This almost barely constitutes as finished. Rome wasn't built with ChatGPT in a day. Patience, please.

## Things to Reckon

* This is not affiliated with the Brickadia team or any other projects documenting the game's features themselves. What I do is my own intepretation
of my guide. Here's one objectively good thing I can say about my guide: It does not use the ad-filled and bloated Fandom.com.
* Do not ask me to update this every day the build number goes up by 1 or you will get banished to the basement. You certainly do not want to anger me.
* This is a part time project meaning that I won't be there 24/7 making or attending to the guide. Please be mindful of my time.
I have other priorities too and just because I'm a Brickadia contributor with accessible contact credentials does not mean you have ownership of what I do.
* Transphobes, racists, colorists, featurists, xenophobics, ableists and etc. are not welcome and this will get screenshotted in some trash heap's website which
I will be happy about, because you openly declaring that we should not exist gives us good warning to evade you. Sad that this has to be said in the 20's.

> I am not accepting contributions or additions under any capacity. The Pull requests tab exists, but most of the time I'm going to ignore it.
> Make an issue if you spot something wrong with the guide or the website.

## Making an issue

There is no template format for issues, but please specify your computer/device hardware/browser if you can. This gets me down to the issue faster.
I'm dumb, but not dumb enough to screw up a bug fix. Not like I should have to - mkdocs and Material seem to be very stable 99.5% of the time.

> [!CAUTION]
> Bunk/AI generated issues will be removed on sight. Stop wasting the time of freelancers and programmers alike. Learn documenting bugs on your own.
> You ain't going to earn that bughunting stipend just because you think your little AI-powered insight is worth reading. You have not read it, how do
> you know it is any worth it? You don't.

## Content Usage Policy

I have attached a CC0 license to this project. This means that you can do everything, including the following:

* Archiving this repository in your local files, which **I encourage you to do** because I feel like platforms these days are really fickle and may use
some rules as an excuse to delete someone's hardwork
* Forking the guide (for localization or everything sugar spice and nice)
* Printing out the content in the site
* Eating all prints of the site
* Steal the entirety of this repository to make a guide (standards are different from wiki to wiki.
Plagiarism is a bad thing but copying all my content from this guide does not constitute you as a plagiarist. Just lazy if you don't attribute.)
* Read it 365 days of the year because you forgot what one thing in your circuit does
* Throw it to a bunch of 60 year olds, maybe they remember playing Brickadia at some point and reading the guide
