# dessert-brickadia-guide

A Brickadia guide I am in charge of.

I am not accepting contributions or additions under any capacity. The Pull requests tab exists, but most of the time I'm going to ignore it.
Make an issue if you spot something wrong with the guide or the website. Or just run your own fork or something.

> [!WARNING]
> This is still in a very early state. Over time, things will be significantly improved and more content will be added.

## Making an issue

There is no template format for issues, but please specify your computer/device hardware/browser if you can. This gets me down to the issue faster.
I'm dumb, but not dumb enough to screw up a bug fix. Not like I should have to - mkdocs and Material seem to be very stable 99.5% of the time.

> [!CAUTION]
> Slop issues will be removed on sight. I will most likely not get them but maybe you will be laughing a bit when I add the slop tag to an issue.
> Probably not so much for the person that posted said issue, though I wager that being constructive comes from a place of care.

## Things to Reckon

* This is not affiliated with the Brickadia team or any other projects documenting the game's features themselves. What I do is my own intepretation
of my guide.
* This is a part time project meaning that I won't be there 24/7 making or attending to the guide. Please be mindful of my time.
I have other priorities too and just because you own my accessible contact credentials does not mean you have ownership of what I do.
* Transphobes, racists and etc. are not welcome. Thanks. I do not have to explain otherwise.

## Content Usage Policy

I have attached a CC0 license to this project. This means that you can do everything, including the following:

* Archiving this repository in your local files, which **I encourage you to do** because I feel like platforms these days are really fickle and may use
some rules as an excuse to delete someone's hard work
* Forking the guide (for localization or everything sugar, spice and nice)
* Printing out the content in the site
* Eating and licking all prints of the site
* Steal the entirety of this repository to make another guide (standards are different from wiki to wiki.
Plagiarism is a bad thing but copying all my content from this guide does not constitute you as a plagiarist. Just lazy if you don't attribute.)
* Read it 365 days of the year because you forgot what one thing in your circuit does
* Throw it to a bunch of 60 year olds, maybe they remember playing Brickadia at some point and reading the guide
