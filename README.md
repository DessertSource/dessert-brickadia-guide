A Brickadia guide I am in charge of.

I am not accepting contributions or additions under any capacity. The Pull requests tab exists, but most of the time I'm going to ignore it.
Make an issue if you spot something wrong with the guide or the website. Or just run your own fork or something.

Formerly on Material for Mkdocs, now on Zensical by the same developers of Material for Mkdocs.
